# Semi-complete implementation of a certain birds API. For fun and glory.

Currently the API is implemented, but only works with default, test,
unauthorised MongoDB instance. The storage engine implementation has tests, but
not the web resources. And, obviously, documentation could use some elaboration.

# Python environment

You can find list of python packages required in requirements.txt, coming
straight from development virtualenv. To replicate python environment:

1. Make sure you are using Python 3.
2. (optional) Prepare and activate virtual environment.
3. pip install -r requirements.txt

# Does it run?

You can run a test instance of the application using reference implementation of
a WSGI server by just running the birds package. It requires a default,
test, unauthorised MongoDB instance running.

1. Make sure you are in the repository top-level directory.
2. Run: python -m birds
3. The server, it is running!

# Show me your tests

This uses standard unittest module for testing.

1. Make sure you are in the repository top-level directory.
2. Run: python -m unittest discover
